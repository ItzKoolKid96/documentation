Dashactyl is a client area control dashboard that allows users to view and manage their resources for their servers. They can create as many servers as they are given, with customisable RAM, Disk, CPU limits and controls. The client area uses [Pterodactyl](https://pterodactyl.io) as the game panel and utilizes its API to create the servers and users.

This version of dashactyl is currently only Credentials login. Discord Login should soon be added.

If you encounter any issues installing Dashactyl, [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/nDxrPWh8pk) and use one of the dedicated support channels to ask your question.

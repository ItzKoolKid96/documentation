# Installation

:::warning READ BEFORE PROCEEDING!
We've spent hours making this documentation. You're supposed to at least have basic linux knowledge, and you're also supposed to understand what commands you're running.
:::

Before you begin installation, make sure you have NodeJS v14 or above, git CLI, and Node Package Manager (NPM) v7.x or above installed.

```

Now to install Dashactyl and its dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Votion-Development/Dashactyl.git
cd Dashactyl && npm install
```

After installing Dashactyl, create the `settings.yml` file using the `settings-template.yml` file and edit it for your dashboard.
```bash
mv settings-template.yml settings.yml
nano settings.yml
```

## Windows

- Git CLI: https://git-scm.com/download/win
- NPM and NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/

You can check the versions with the following commands:
```bat
git --version
npm -v
node -v
```

Now to install Dashactyl and its dependencies:
```bat
git clone https://github.com/Votion-Development/Dashactyl.git
